/**
 * Main robot class that manages the robot's lifecycle and operational modes.
 * This class follows the TimedRobot model, executing code in a timed loop for each robot mode.
 * 
 * <p>Features include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Autonomous command management
 *   <li>Teleop control initialization
 *   <li>Test mode handling
 *   <li>Periodic updates across all modes
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The robot code is organized using WPILib's command-based framework, with subsystems
 * and commands managed through the RobotContainer class.
